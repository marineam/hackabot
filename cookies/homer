As far as anyone knows we're a nice, normal family. -- Homer Simpson
%
It says it's for dogs, but she can't read. -- Homer Simpson
%
Lisa: Remember, Dad.  The handle of the Big Dipper points to the 
 North Star.
Homer: That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class.  We're in
 the woods.
%
Yeah.  Wait a minute.  It's the guy from TV.  My kid's 
hero...Cruddy...Crummy...Krusty the Clown! -- Homer Simpson
%
Uh, so.  Let's have a conversation.  Uh, I think we'll find that we have
very little in common. -- Homer Simpson
%
Don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister.  I
want to see you both fighting for your parents' love. -- Homer Simpson
%
I don't want to look like a weirdo.  I'll just go with a muumuu. -- Homer Simpson
%
Oh my God!  Space aliens!  Don't eat me, I have a wife and kids!  Eat
them. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do
every morning. -- Homer Simpson
%
You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.  She
said, `Homer, you're a big disappointment,' and, God bless her soul, she
was really onto something. -- Homer Simpson
%
Lisa: So gambling makes a good thing even better?
Homer: That's right.  My God, it's like there's some kind of bond
 between us.
%
Jeez.  No beer ... no opera dogs ... -- Homer Simpson
%
You're everywhere.  You're omnivorous. -- Homer Simpson, to God
%
I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what
about those really smart ones who live among us who rollerskate and smoke
cigars? -- Homer Simpson, on Heaven
%
You know something, folks, as ridiculous as this sounds, I would rather
feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I
sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. -- Homer Simpson
%
Could this be the best day of my life? -- Homer Simpson
%
Kirk: One day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day
 you're thawin'a hot dog in a gas station sink.
Homer: Oh, that's tough, pal.  But it's never gonna happen to me.
%
See these?  American donuts.  Glazed, powdered, and raspberry-filled.
Now, how's that for freedom of choice. -- Homer Simpson
%
The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show
starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, `the gruesome twosome.' -- Homer Simpson
%
I'm not a bad guy.  I work hard and I love my kids.  So why should I spend
half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell? -- Homer Simpson
%
Mmm...incapacitating. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge, try to understand.  There are two kinds of college students: jocks
and nerds.  As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time. -- Homer Simpson
%
Listen, you big, stupid space-creature.  Nobody, but nobody, eats the
Simpsons! -- Homer Simpson
%
I wore my extra loose pants for nothing.  Nothing! -- Homer Simpson
%
You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here!  Your family is better
than my family, your beer comes from farther away than my beer, you and
your son like each other, your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt!
You make me sick! -- Homer Simpson
%
Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this.  It is not okay to
lose. -- Homer Simpson
%
As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to
do with alcohol.  It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: What?!  Flanders!  You're the Devil?
Devil Flanders:
 Ho-oh, it's always the one you least suspect.
%
D'oh!  English!  Who needs that?  I'm never going to England. Come on,
let's smoke. -- Homer Simpson, talking Barney into cutting class
%
They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy. -- Homer Simpson
%
I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will
get you through life.  Number one, `Cover for me.'  Number two, `Oh, good
idea, boss.'  Number three, `It was like that when I got here.' -- Homer Simpson
%
Always remember that you're representing our country.  I guess what I'm
saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room. -- Homer Simpson
%
I can't believe I ate the whole thing. -- Homer Simpson
%
Barney: Boy, you never stop eating and you don't gain a pound.
Homer: It's my metaba-ma-lism.  I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones.
%
Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much.  But you're living in a
world of makebelieve.  With flowers and bells and leprechauns.  And magic
frogs with funny little hats... -- Homer Simpson
%
Did you hear that, Marge?  She called me a baboon!  The stupidest,
ugliest, smelliest ape of them all! -- Homer Simpson
%
Holy Moly!  The bastard's rich! -- Homer Simpson
%
Love isn't hopeless.  Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject, but there
was one time I got it right. -- Homer Simpson
%
First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun
of the way I talk -- probably -- now he steals my right to raise a
disobedient, smart-alecky son!  Well, that's it! -- Homer Simpson
%
If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise! -- Homer Simpson
%
Keep brain from freezing. -- Homer Simpson
%
Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind.  I haven't felt this way 
since `Funky Town.' -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?
Homer: Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty
 dollars here.
%
Marge: Homer, you're his father.  You've got to reason with him.
Homer: Oh, that never works.  He's a goner!
%
I thought there was chocolate inside ... Well, why was it wrapped in foil? -- Homer Simpson
%
I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world.  He's a 
jerk -- end of story. -- Homer Simpson
%
Well, you know boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman.  You just
have to read the manual and press the right button. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
Bart: Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
Homer: Why you little -- !
%
I wish for a turkey sandwich on rye bread with lettuce and mustard.  And -- and I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey
myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises -- you got it? -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: I'm a bad father!
Selma: You're also fat!
Homer: I'm also fat!
%
Foul temptress.  I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: No TV and No Beer Make Homer ... something something.
Marge: Go crazy?
Homer: Don't mind if I do!
%
It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the
eighties.  Those were idealistic days: the candidacy of John Anderson,
the rise of Supertramp.  It was an exciting time to be young. -- Homer Simpson
%
Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: I don't want you to see me sitting on my worthless butt.
Bart: We've seen it, Dad.
%
Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat.  It also gives me the 
right -- no, the duty -- to make a complete ass of myself. -- Homer Simpson
%
Herb: I want you to help me design a car.  A car for all the Homer
 Simpsons out there!  And I want to pay you two hundred thousand
 dollars a year!
Homer: And I want to let you!
%
Homer: There couldn't be heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart: Who's in there?
Homer: Oh, uh ... Hitler's dog.  And that dog Nixon had, whassisname, um,
 Chester ...
Lisa: Checkers.
Homer: Yeah!  One of the Lassies is in there, too.  The mean one -- the
 one that mauled Jimmy.
%
Losers!  Losers!  Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville! -- Homer Simpson
%
The doll's trying to kill me, and the toaster's been laughing at me. -- Homer Simpson
%
Karl: You don't belong here.  You're a fraud and a phony and it's only
 a matter of time until they find you out.
Homer: (gasps)  Who told you?
%
Bart: What'd you do?  Screw up like the Beatles and say you were bigger
 than Jesus?
Homer: All the time.  It was the title of our second album.
%
Kirk: What makes you guys so special?
Homer: Because Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a
 strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
%
Ah, sweet pity: where would my love life have been without it? -- Homer Simpson
%
Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk, I just went to a strange fantasy world. -- Homer Simpson
%
Bart: So, like sometimes you can do stuff that you think is pretty bad
 so other kids will like you better?
Homer: You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
%
I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress 'em up, and make 'em reenact the Civil
War!  Heh, heh, heh! -- Homer Simpson
%
Weaseling out of things is important to learn.  It's what separates us
from the animals.  Except the weasel. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies
 away.
Bart and Lisa:
 Noooooo!
Homer: Mainly your mother.
%
Homer: Okay, okay, don't panic.  To find Flanders, I just have to think
 like Flanders!
Homer's Brain:
 I'm a big four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater
 everyday, and --
Homer: The Springfield River!
%
It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my life forever. -- Homer Simpson
%
We live in a society of laws.  Why do you think I took you to all those
"Police Academy" movies?  For fun?  Well, I didn't hear anybody laughin',
did you? -- Homer Simpson
%
Stealing?!  How could you?!  Haven't you learned anything from that
guy who gives those sermons at church?  Captain What's-his-name? -- Homer Simpson
%
Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man, and
old people are useless. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Little baby batter,
 Can't control his bladder!
Burns: Mmm...Crude, but I like it.  What do you say we freshen up out
 little drinkie poos?
Homer: Don't mind if I do.
%
Homer: Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying.  I already did the same thing,
 and we can't both win.
Flanders:
 Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
%
Asleep at the switch!  I wasn't asleep!  I was drunk! -- Homer Simpson
%
Hey!  Let's do that 2,000-pound man thing.  I'll be that Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face. -- Homer Simpson
%
Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.  People die all the time.
Just like that.  Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow.  Well, good night. -- Homer Simpson
%
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday?  I
mean, isn't God everywhere? -- Homer Simpson
%
And anyone can be tooted? -- Homer Simpson, on tutoring
%
Flanders:
 Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors, but you made us
 friends.
Homer: To Ned Flanders, the richest left-handed man in town.
%
There's an empty spot I've always had inside me.  I tried to fill it with
family, religion, community service.  But those were all dead ends.  I
think this chair is the answer. -- Homer Simpson
%
Bart: Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!
Homer: He was a zombie?
%
If it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing
defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead. -- Homer Simpson
%
See you in hell, candy boys!! -- Homer Simpson
%
All right.  His story checks out. -- Homer Simpson, checking in the encyclopedia
%
I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV!  This one's
for real! -- Homer Simpson
%
Hmmm, look at those eyes.  He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the
good Las Vegas way. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge!  I'm two-thirty-nine, and I'm feeling fine! -- Homer Simpson
%
I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too ... I mean, we
could sit here and try to figure out who forgot to pick up who till the
cows come home.  But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that. -- Homer Simpson
%
Well if it isn't the leader of the weiner patrol, boning up on his nerd
lessons! -- Homer Simpson
%
Yeah.  Maybe I do have the right ... What's that stuff? -- Homer Simpson
%
And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest,
safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe
dream. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge, you being a cop makes you the man!  Which makes me the woman -- and
I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear,
which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. -- Homer Simpson
%
Hello?  Yes?  Oh!  Heh, heh, uh ... if you're looking for that big donut
of yours ... um, Flanders has it.  Just smash open his house.  (Closing
the door.)  He came to life.  Good for him. -- Homer Simpson
%
He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of
charging $6.95 for it. -- Moe Syzlak
%
Wh ... what's going on?  Wh ... wha ... why am I on a Japanese box? -- Homer Simpson
%
Wait a minute, Marge.  I saw "Mrs. Doubtfire."  This is a man in drag! -- Homer Simpson
%
Abe: I used to be `with it.'  But then they changed what `it' was.  Now
 what I'm `with' isn't `it' and what's `it' seems weird and scary
 to me.  It'll happen to you.
Homer: No way, man.  We're gonna keep on rockin' forever!
%
Yes!  Oh, yes!  Read it and weep!  In your face -- I got more chicken
bone! -- Homer Simpson
%
Must destroy mankind!  (His watch alarm goes off)  Ooh, lunchtime! -- Homer Simpson
%
Okay, Marge, as long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous
story of my own. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?
Homer: Yup, pretty much.  Except we drove around in a van solving
 mysteries.
%
Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat
him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence.
Heh heh heh.  The perfect crime. -- Homer Simpson
%
Pfft.  Now you tell me. -- Homer Simpson, finding out that working at a nuclear
%
I'll work from midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat
breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to bask
in Lisa's love, then I'm off to the power plant fresh as a daisy. -- Homer Simpson
%
Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an
appropriate time.  Like that day I hit that referee with a whiskey 
bottle.  'Member that? -- Homer Simpson
%
Come here, you little raven! -- Homer Simpson
%
Your mother seems really upset.  I better go have a talk with 
her -- during the commercial. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: The secret ingredient is --
Moe: Homer, no!
Homer: Cough syrup!  Nothing but plain, ordinary, over-the-counter 
 children's cough syrup!
%
Hee, hee!  I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! -- Homer Simpson
%
I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the
lightbulb. -- Homer Simpson
%
It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart.  Lisa,
maybe you should try some of this. -- Homer Simpson
%
Dammit, I'm no supervising technician.  I'm a technical supervisor.  It's
too late to teach this old dog new tricks. -- Homer Simpson
%
That shot is impossible!  Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
Pump Jockey:
 It's your heart.  And I think it's on its last thump.
Homer: Whew, I was afraid it was my transmission.
%
Rock 'n' Roll had become stagnant.  `Achy Breaky Heart' was seven years
away.  Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop. -- Homer Simpson
%
Flanders!  My socks feel dirty!  Gimme some water to wash 'em! -- Homer Simpson
%
Kent: Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been
 causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
Homer: Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.
%
Marge, there's just too much pressure, what with my job, the kids, traffic
snarls, political strife at home and abroad.  But I promise you, the second
all of those things go away, we'll have sex. -- Homer Simpson
%
It works on any Ayatollah!  Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi ... Even
as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating
their power! -- Homer Simpson
%
Um, it's like, uh ... did anyone see the movie `Tron'? -- Homer Simpson
%
I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. -- Homer Simpson
%
You can't depend on me all your lives.  You have to learn that there's a
little Homer Simpson in all of us. -- Homer Simpson
%
When will I learn?  The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of
a bottle.  They're on TV! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: This place is depressing.
Grampa: Hey!  I live here.
Homer: Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. -- Homer Simpson
%
Lisa: Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
Homer: Well, thank you, honey. -- Homer Simpson
%
Selma: It's time to give away my love like so much cheap wine.
Homer: Take it to the hoop, Selma! -- Homer Simpson
%
Burns: Good Lord, Smithers!  You look atrocious.  I thought I told you to
 take a vacation.
Homer: Uh, Smithers already left, sir.  I'm his replacement, Homer
 Simpson.
%
Bart: Oh, cheer up, Mom.  You can't buy publicity like that.  Thousands
 and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford.
Homer: You can call them Whitey-whackers! -- Homer Simpson
%
Oh, `no attitude,' eh?  Not `in your face,' huh?  Well, you can cram it
with walnuts, ugly! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in
 town.
Marge: Maybe we should move to a larger community.
%
Two-hundred-thirty-nine pounds?!  I'm a blimp!  Why are all the good
things so tasty? -- Homer Simpson
%
And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a
single proven fatality, at least in this country. -- Homer Simpson
%
Quiet, you kids!  If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch
cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college. -- Homer Simpson
%
Bart: I had a fight with Milhouse.
Homer: That four-eyes with the big nose?  You don't need friends like
 that.
Lisa: How Zen. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were
 discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Scully: Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.
Homer: We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard.  Ya
 happy?
%
Flanders:
 They're not perfect, but the Lord says love they neighbor --
Homer: Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders:
 Okely-dokely-do.
%
Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I
thought it's be fun and exciting, like the movie `Spaceballs.'  But
instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like the movie `Police
Academy.' -- Homer Simpson
%
Bart: Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me.  How do you feel?
Homer: Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his
 conversion by Ambrose of Milan. -- Homer Simpson
%
That's fine for you, Marge.  But I used to rock and roll all night and
party every day.  Then it was every other day.  Now I'm lucky if I can
find half an hour a week in which to get funky.  I've got to get out of
this rut and back into the groove! -- Homer Simpson
%
Good morning, fellow employee.  You'll notice that I am now a model 
worker.  We should continue this conversation later, during the designated
break periods.  Sincerely, Homer Simpson. -- Homer Simpson
%
A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center. -- Homer Simpson
%
Apu: You look familiar, sir.  Are you on the television or something?
Homer: Sorry, buddy.  You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
%
Now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  That's for daddys, and kids with
fake IDs. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six
 servings a week?
Homer: Marge, I'm only human.
%
Oh, look at me!  I'm making people happy.  I'm the magical man from
Happyland in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Laaane!  Oh, by the way, I
was being sarcastic. -- Homer Simpson
%
I may just quit my job at the plant to become a full-time stock market
guy. -- Homer Simpson
%
Why did this have to happen now, during prime time, when TV's
brightest stars come out to shine? -- Homer Simpson
%
Oh my God, someone's trying to kill me!  Oh wait, it's for Bart. -- Homer Simpson
%
It all happened during the magical summer of 1985.  A maturing Joe
Piscopo left `Saturday Night Live' to conquer Hollywood; People
Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel; and I was
in a barbershop quartet. -- Homer Simpson
%
Burns: I can't understand a word you're saying.
Homer: My name is Homer Simpson!
Burns: You're just babbling incoherently...
Homer: Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.  Oh, you're dead!  You're dead,
 Burns!
%
Burns: Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club!  A
 sand wedge!
Homer: Mmm ... open-faced club sandwich.
%
Woman: Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very
 valuable stone gargoyle, and -- Are you wearing a grocery bag?
Homer: I have misplaced my pants.
%
Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and
love our family's experienced ... well, not today.  You saw what
happened.  Oh, Lord, be honest.  Are we the most pathetic family in
the universe, or what? -- Homer Simpson
%
This is the greatest thrill of my life!  I'm king of the world!  Wooo,
wooo!  Wooo, wooo! -- Homer Simpson
%
Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike.  You just go in
every day and do it really half-assed.  That's the American way. -- Homer Simpson
%
Oh, I love your magazine.  My favorite section is `How to Increase
Your Word Power.'  That thing is really, really, really ... good. -- Homer Simpson
%
One day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about
for generations.  You may outsmart someone. -- Homer Simpson
%
The code of the schoolyard, Marge!  The rules that teach a boy how to
be a man!  Let's see; don't tattle, always make fun of those different
from you, never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly
the same way you do. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Ooh, look at this one!  The Hammer of Thor!  (Reading)  "It
 will send your pins to ... Valhalla?"  Lisa?
Lisa: Valhalla is where vikings go when they die.
Homer: Ooh, that's some ball.
%
Marge: Name one of your child's friends.
Homer: Uh, let's see, Bart's friends ... Well, there's the fat kid
 with the thing; uh, the little wiener whose always got his
 hands in his pockets.
%
Smithers:
 Next.  There's a problem with the reactor -- what do you do?
Homer: There's a problem with the reactor??  We're all going to die!!
%
Hey, if you're going to get mad at me every time I do something
stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things! -- Homer Simpson
%
I'm tired of being a wanna-be league bowler, I wanna be a league bowler! -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible
 say, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you
 do unto me...?"
Homer: Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, "Thou shalt not take
 moochers into thy hut?"
%
Homer: All right, Herb.  I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks.  But you have
 to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
Herb: Nope.
Homer: All right, then, just give me the drinking bird.
%
Burns: Well, Simpson, I must say, once you're been through something
 like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.
Homer: You said it, you weirdo.
%
Marge, please, old people don't need companionship.  They need to be
isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have
that might be extracted for our personal use. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: Maybe it'll turn out that he was innocent all along.
Homer: Earth to Marge.  Earth to Marge.  I was there ... the clown's
 G-I-L-L-T-Y. 
%
Oh, cruel fate.  Why do you mock me? -- Homer Simpson
%
Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh
start with Maggie. -- Homer Simpson
%
Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing
out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new belly button. -- Homer Simpson
%
Boy, I don't know.  You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot. -- Homer Simpson
%
You mean, I'm on my own?  I've never been on my own.  Oh no!  On 
own!  On own!  I need help.  Oh, God help me!  Help me, God! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Is this episode going on the air live?
June Bellamy:
 No, Homer.  Very few cartoons are broadcast live -- it's a 
 terrible strain on the animators' wrists.

Homer: Hey, Burns!  Eat my shorts!
Burns: Who the Sam Hill was that?
%
Six simple words: I'm not gay, but I'll learn. -- Homer Simpson
%
Donuts.  Is there anything they can't do? -- Homer Simpson
%
Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans.
Sure I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no! -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: You like parties, huh?  Well, I just remembered they're having
 a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.
Marge: You didn't remember that.  You just saw it on TV.
%
Even the Chinese are against me. -- Homer Simpson
%
Homer: Here's your magazines.  How many of these guys are named Corey?
Lisa: Eight.  Thanks, Dad.
%
No, I do not know what the Schadenfreude is.  Please tell me, because
I'm dying to know. -- Homer Simpson
%
I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer.  Basically, we
become a family of traveling acrobats. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge, let's end this feudin' and a-fussin' and get down to some lovin'. -- Homer Simpson
%
It takes two to lie.  One to lie and one to listen. -- Homer Simpson
%
When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, bloodsucking
monsters, always wanting more, more, more!  And if you give it to 'em, 
you'll get back plenty in return. -- Homer Simpson
%
I'm sick of eating hoagies!  I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long
hero!  I want to live, Marge!  Won't you let me live?  Won't you,
please? -- Homer Simpson
%
The weak and nerdy are admired for their computer-programming abilities. -- Homer Simpson
%
Kids, kids, kids.  As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential
murderers. -- Homer Simpson
%
Marge: We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.
Homer: Well, you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for
 diseases she doesn't even have.

Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons! -- Homer Simpson

TV Announcer:
 The following is a public service announcement: Excessive
 alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and cancer of the

Fathers' who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about
`What's to be done with this Homer Simpson"' -- Homer Simpson
%
It's okay, Marge.  I've learned my lesson.  A mountain of sugar is too
much for one man.  It's clear now why God portions it out in those 
tiny packets, and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii. -- Homer Simpson

Marge, what's wrong?  Are you hungry?  Sleepy?  Gassy?  Gassy?  Is it

Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya! -- Homer Simpson

Homer: Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to

other people.'  `I no speak English.'  `I'm married to the sea.'  `I
don't want to kill you, but I will ...' -- Homer Simpson
%
They said the same thing about Urkle; that little snot.  Boy I'd like
to smack that kid. -- Homer Simpson

Marge: Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of
 your life?
Homer: Of course not, Marge, just for the rest of his life.

It's a fixer-upper.  What's the problem?  We get a bunch of priests in

the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore. -- Homer Simpson
%
It's wonderful, it's magical.  Oh boy, here it comes.  Another mouth. -- Homer Simpson
%
I guess Bart's not to blame.  He's lucky, too, because it's spanking
season, and I got a hankering for some spankering! -- Homer Simpson
%
Aw, being a clown sucks.  You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and

the clowning business. -- Homer Simpson
