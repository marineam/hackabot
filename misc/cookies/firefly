Mal: "We're not gonna die. We can't die, Bendis. You know why? Because we are so...very...pretty. We are just too pretty for God to let us die."

Mal: "We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."

Mal: "If you can't do something smart, do something right."

Inara: "This is just a moment in time.  Step aside and let it happen."

Mal: "When you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that, you find someone to carry you."

Early: "Well... here I am..."

Mal (naked, alone in the desert): "Yep... that went well."

Wash: "Everything looks good from here... (beat...playing with plastic dinosaurs over his console) Yes. Yes, this is a fertile land, and we will thrive." 
(as Stegosaurus) "We will rule over all this land, and we will call it...
'This Land'."

Mal: "I don't believe there's a power in the 'verse that can stop Kaylee from being cheerful." (he smiles at her, never stopping working) "Sometimes you just wanna duct tape her mouth and dump her in the hold for a month."

Mal: "Politely."

Book: "The destination's not important.  How you get there's the worthier part."

Jayne: "I was gonna get me an ear."
%
Book: "I brought you some supper but if you'd prefer a lecture, I've a few very catchy ones prepped...sin and hellfire... one has lepers."
%
Jayne: "Testing, testing. Captain, can you hear me?"
Mal: "I'm standing right here."
Jayne: "You're coming through good and loud."
Mal: " 'Cause I'm standing right here."
%
Mal: "Well, you were right about this being a bad idea."
Zoe: "Thanks for sayin', sir."
%
Mal: "Say that to my face."
Man: I said, you're a coward, and a pisspot.  Now what are you going to do?
Mal: "I just wanted you to face me so she could get behind you." (Zoe punches the thug out) "Drunks are so cute."
%
Mal: (into com) "Wash, we've got some local color happening. Your grand entrance would not go amiss right now."
%
(Zoe, Mal, and Jayne are backed up against the edge of a cliff by a bunch of drunken brawlers)
Mal: "There's just an acre of you fellas, ain't there?" (to Zoe) "This is why we lost, you know. Superior numbers." 
Zoe: "Thanks for the re-enactment, sir."
%
Mal: "Well they tell you: never hit a man with a closed fist. But it is, on occasion, hilarious." 
%
Mal: "Well, what about you, Shepherd? How come you're flying about with us brigands? I mean, shouldn't you be off bringing religiosity to the Fuzzie-Wuzzies or some such?" 
Book: "Oh, I got heathens aplenty right here." 
Mal: "If I'm your mission, Shepherd, best give it up. You're welcome on my boat. God ain't." 
%
Inara: (pissed) "What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle?"
Mal: "That it was manly and impulsive?"
Inara: "Yes, precisely. Only the exact phrase I used was 'don't'."
%
Mal: "And Kaylee, what the hell's goin' on in the engine room? Were there monkeys? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose?"

Jayne: "Time for some thrilling heroics."

Jayne: "These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me."

Zoe: "Proximity alert. Must be coming up on something." 
Wash: (alarmed) "Oh my god. What can it be? We're all doomed! Who's flying this thing!?" (deadpan) "Oh right, that would be me. Back to work." 
%
Kaylee: "Looks like they've jerry-rigged it with a pressure catch. It's the only thing that'd work with all these spare parts. We could probably bypass that easy, we get to the DC line." 
Mal: "You tell me right now, little Kaylee, you really think you can do this?" 
Kaylee: "Sure. Yeah. I think so. 'Sides, if I mess up, not like you'll be able to yell at me."

Alliance Commander: "You fought with Captain Reynolds in the war?" 
Zoe: "Fought with a lot of people in the war." 
Alliance Commander: "And your husband?" 
Zoe: "Fight with him sometimes, too."

Alliance Commander: "Seems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of." 
Mal: "May have been the losing side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one."

Wash: (Off an alarm sounding from the console) "Closing in." 
Zoe: "Planet's coming up a mite fast."

Mal: "Well, that happens, let me know." 
%
Kaylee: (pointing to a pink frilly dress) "Say, look at the fluffy one!" 
Zoe: "Too much foofaraw. If I'm going to wear a dress, I'd want something with some slink." 
Wash: "You want a slinky dress? I can buy you a slinky dress. Captain, can I have money for a slinky dress?" 
Jayne: "I'll chip in." 
Zoe: (to Jayne) "I can hurt you." 
%
Kaylee: "I like the ruffles.  Inara gets to wear whatever she wants.

(Kaylee storms off)
Zoe: "See ya on the ship, Captain."
%
Mal: "Does, uh... does this seem kind of tight?" 
Kaylee: "Shows off your backside. Did you see the chandelier? It's moving." 
%
Kaylee: "These girls have the most beautiful dresses. And so do I-- how 'bout that!" 
Mal: "Yeah, well, just be careful. We cheated Badger out of good money to buy that frippery, and you're supposed to make me look respectable." 
Kaylee: "Yessir, Captain Tight Pants." 
%
Mal: "Okay, help me find our man; he's supposed to be older. Kind of stocky, wears a red sash crossways." 
Kaylee: "Why does he do that?" 
Mal: "Maybe he won the Miss Persephone pageant. Just help me look." 
%
Harrow: "I know him. And I think he's a psychotic lowlife." 
Mal: "And I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community."

Kaylee: "I'm not saying the 80-04's hard to repair, it just ain't worth it."
Older farmer: "It's a fine machine, you just keep it tuned. "
Kaylee: [Tsai boo shr. - "That's not it."] "The extenders ain't braced. "
Murphy: "I've been telling him to buy the 80-10 for years."
Kaylee: "Those 'tenders snap off, don't matter how good the engine's cycling."
Younger farmer: "Miss Kaylee, I wonder if I could request the honor of.... "
Murphy: (interrupting) "Wait a minute. Let her talk. She's talking. Dance later. "
Kaylee: "By the way, the 80-10's the same machine, they just changed the plating and hope no one noticed. "

Inara: "Attack." (Mal lunges at her with sword; she sidesteps and swats him on the butt; he grunts in pain) "How did I avoid that?" 
Mal: "By being fast like a freak?" 
%
Harrow: "You have to finish it, lad. You have to finish it. For a man to lay beaten... and yet breathing? It makes him a coward." 
Inara: "It's humiliation." 
Mal: "Sure. It would be humiliating. Having to lie there while the better man refuses to spill your blood. Mercy is the mark of a great man. (lightly stabs Atherton with the sword) Guess I'm just a good man. (stabs him again) Well, I'm all right." 
%
Harrow: "You didn't have to wound the man." 
Mal: "Yeah, I know, it was just funny." 
%
Inara: "Thank you for the wine. It's very... fresh." 
Mal: "To Kaylee, and her inter-engine fermentation system."

Inara: "Are you in pain?" 
Mal: "Absolutely. I got stabbed, you know. Right here." 
Inara: "I saw." 
Mal: "Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough." 
Inara: "It wasn't entirely a disaster." 
Mal: "I got stabbed! Right here!" 
%
Mal: "So, she's added cussing and hurling about of things to her repertoire.
She really is a prodigy." 
Simon: "It's just a bad day." 
Mal: "No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. Understand? You ever see cattle stampede when they got no place to run? It's kind of like a...a meat grinder. And it'll lose us half the herd." 
Simon: "She hasn't gone anywhere near the cattle." 
Mal: "No, but in case you hadn't noticed, her voice kinda carries. We're two miles above ground and they can probably hear her down there. Soon as we unload, she can holler until our ears bleed." (to River) "Although I would take it as a kindness if she didn't." 
River: "The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems." 
Mal: (to Simon) "See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like." 
%
Book: "That bad?" 
Zoe: "Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. I've seen men live
with a dozen holes in 'em this size." 
Book: "That right?"

%
Zoe: "You sanguine about the kind of reception we're apt to receive on an Alliance ship, Cap'n?" 
Mal: "Absolutely." (beat) "What's 'sanguine' mean?" 
Zoe: " 'Sanguine'. Hopeful. Plus -- point of interest -- it also means 'bloody'." 
Mal: "Well, that pretty much covers all the options, don't it?" 
%
Mal: "What kind of ident card gets us that kind of reception and send off?"
Book: "I am a Shepherd. Folks like a man of God." 
Mal: "No, they don't. Men of God make everyone feel guilty and judged." 
%
Mal: "Well, look at this! Appears we got here just in the nick of time. Whaddya suppose that makes us?" 
Zoe: "Big damn heroes, sir." 
Mal: "Ain't we just!" 
Mal: "Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? Now I'm not saying you weren't easy to find but it was kinda out of our
way, and he didn't want to come in the first place. Man's lookin' to kill some folk. So really, it's his will y'all should worry about thwarting." (to Simon) "Gotta say, doctor, your talent for alienatin' folk is near miraculous." 
Simon: "Yes, I'm very proud." 
%
Simon: "So finally...a decent wound on this ship, and I miss out. I'm sorry." 
Mal: "Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire. It happens."

Bandit #1: "And I think maybe you're gonna give me a little one-on-one time with the missus." 
(Husband) Jayne: "Oh, I think you might wanna reconsider that last part. See, I married me a powerful ugly creature." 
(Wife) Mal: "How can you say that? How can you shame me in front of new people?" 
(Husband) Jayne: "If I could make you purtier, I would." 
(Wife) Mal: "You are not the man I met a year ago." (they suddenly draw their guns on the bandits, Mal slowly pulling his bonnet off) 
Mal: "Now think real hard. You been bird-dogging this township a while now. They wouldn't mind a corpse of you. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I
will end you."
%
Inara: "So, explain to me again why Zoe wasn't in the dress?" 
Mal: "Tactics, woman! Needed her in the back. 'Sides, them soft cotton dresses feel kind of nice. There's a whole airflow." 
Inara: "And you would know that because...?" 
Mal: "You can't open the book of my life and jump in the middle. Like woman, I'm a mystery." 
Inara: "Best keep it that way. I withdraw the question."

Book: "If you take sexual advantage of her, you're going to burn in a very special level of hell. A level they reserve for child molesters and people who talk at the theater."

Book: "Perhaps I spoke out of turn."
Mal: "You may perhaps I'm thinking!"
Book: "I apologize.  I'll make her up a room in the passenger dorm."
Mal: "Good"

Book: "The *special* hell."

Mal: "Are you offering me a trade?" 
Jayne: "A trade!? Hell, it's theft. This is the best damn gun made by man. It has extreme sentimental value. It's miles more worthy than what you got." 
Mal: "What I got? She has a name." 
Jayne: "So does this!" (caresses the gun lovingly) "I call it Vera."
Mal: "Well, my days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle."

Saffron: "You gonna kill me?" 
Mal: "Can you conjure up a terribly compelling reason for me not to?" 
Saffron: "I didn't kill you."

Saffron: (smiles) "I made you dinner."

Mal: "You wanna tell me how come there's a statue of you here, looking at me like I owe him something?" 
Jayne: "Wishin' I could, Captain." 
Mal: "No, seriously, Jayne, you want to tell me--?" 
Jayne: "Look, Mal, I got no ruttin' idea. I was here a few years back, like I said. Pulled a second-story, stole a lot of scratch from the magistrate up on the hill. But things went way south. I had to hightail it. They don't...put you on a pedestal in town square for that." 
Mal: "Yeah, but I'm looking at some fair compelling evidence says they do." 
Simon: (staring at the statue) "This must be what going mad feels like." 
Jayne: "Uh, hey, I got a idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic 'til I get pinched by the man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work, and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day. How's that?"

Book: "What are we up to, sweetheart?" 
River: "Fixing your Bible." 
Book: "I, um...(alarmed)...what?" 
River: "Bible's broken. Contradictions, false logistics - doesn't make sense." (she's marked up the bible, crossed out passages) 
Book: "No, no. You - you can't... "
River: "So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. Eleven inherent metaphoric parallels already there. Eleven. Important number. Prime number. One goes into the house of eleven eleven times, but always comes out one. Noah's ark is a problem." 
Book: "Really?"

Zoe: "You paid money for this, sir? On purpose?" 
Mal: "What? Come on, seriously, Zoe. Whaddya think?" 
Zoe: "Honestly, sir? I think you got robbed."

Zoe: "It's a piece of fei-oo." [fei-oo. = junk] 
Mal: "Fei-oo? Okay, she won't be winning any beauty contests anytime soon.
But she's solid. Ship like this, be with ya 'til the day you die."

Mal: "Which one do you figured tracked us?" 
Zoe: "The ugly one, sir." 
Mal: (beat) "Could you be more specific?"
%
Mal: "Looks can be deceiving." 
Jayne: "Not as deceiving as a lowdown, dirty... deceiver." 
Mal: "Well said. Wasn't that well said, Zoe?" 
Zoe: "Had a kind of poetry to it, sir."
%
Mal: "I mean, let's say you did kill us... or didn't. There could be torture - whatever - but somehow, you found the goods. What would your cut be?" 
Jayne: "Seven percent, straight off the top." 
Mal: "Seven? Oh." 
Jayne: "What?" 
Mal: "Hm? Nothing. Not a thing. No, I just... (to Zoe) does that seem low to you?" 
Zoe: "It does, sir." 
Jayne: "That ain't low." 
Head Robber: "Stop it!" 
Jayne: "Seven percent, standard."

Simon: "They were cyanotic and not responsive."

Mal: "Two lefts, two rights, and we're there. You see anyone, smile."

Pompous Doctor: "Walk with me a minute."

Pompous Doctor:"You see this badge? It says 'doctor'. I say walk, you walk." 
Mal: "Yeah but, where're we going?" 
Pompous Doctor: "You must be new." (Zoe walks up behind him) "Don't get comfortable, your type never lasts long around here. When your supervisor hears about the rude and disrespect--ARGH!!!" (falls to the ground, unconscious, revealing Zoe standing behind him with defib paddles)

stockings...nothing left but coal."

River: (to Jayne) "Don't look in the closet, either -- it's greedy."

Kaylee: "Hey there, Inara! How was your checkup?"
Inara: "Same as last year. What's going on?"
Kaylee: (cheerfully) "Oh well let's see...we killed Simon and River, stole a bunch of medicine, and the Cap'n and Zoe are springin' the others got snatched by the feds."

Mal: "Hey! How was your thing?"
Inara: "As advertised -- lots of needles and cold exam tables. I heard you had some excitement."

Wash: "You're pretty much down to ritual suicide, lambie-toes."

Wash: "Didn't want you taking off without me. In fact, didn't want you taking off at all. Thought I might take this run instead. Me and the Captain." 
Mal: "The Captain who's standing right here telling you that's not gonna happen?" 
Wash: "Well, it's a dangerous mission, sir. I can't stand the thought of something happening that might cause you two to come back with another thrilling tale of bonding and adventure. I just can't take that right now."

Wash: "I don't want you to spare me, Mal. If you think you know what's happening, then you tell me. You wouldn't spare Zoe if she were in this situation with you, would you? You would be planning, and plotting and possibly scheming. So whatever Zoe would do in this instance is what I wanna do. Do you know why? No matter how ugly it gets, you two always come back with the stories. So... I'm Zoe. Now, what do I do?" 
Mal: "Probably not talk quite so much." 
Wash: "Right. Less talking. She's terse. I can be terse. Once in flight school, I was laconic."

Mal: "This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it?"

Inara: "It sounds like the sort of thing this crew can handle. I can't guarantee they'll handle it particularly well, but-"
Nandi: "If they got guns, and brains at all..."
Inara: "They have guns."
%
Zoe: "No one's gonna force you to go, Jayne. As has been stated -- this job's strictly speculative."
Jayne: "Good. 'Cause I don't know these folks, don't much care to."
Mal: "They're whores."
Jayne: "I'm in."
Mal: "Any friend of Inara's is a strictly business-like relationship of mine."
Jayne: (calls out from across the room) "Can I start gettin' sexed already?"
Mal: "Well, that's one kind of horrific."

Kaylee: "Everybody's got somebody..." (wistfully) "Wash, tell me I'm pretty..."

Kaylee: "Thank you. That was very restorative."

Simon: "You are talking to a doctor."

Wash: "Little River just gets more colorful by the moment. What'll she do next?" 
Zoe: "Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up." 
Wash: "I hope she does the soup thing. It's always a hoot, and we don't all die from it."
%
Mal: "But she does have an oddness to her. And I ain't just talking about her proficiency with firearms. Girl knows things. Things she shouldn't. Things she couldn't." 
Jayne: "Wha-...are you-are you sayin' she's a witch?" 
Wash: (sarcastically) "Yes, Jayne. She's a witch. She has had congress with the beast." 
Jayne: "She's in Congress?" 
Wash: (amazed) "How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious."

Wash: "Psychic, though? That sounds like something out of science fiction." 
Zoe: "We live in a space ship, dear."

Early: "You know, with the exception of one deadly and unpredictable midget, this girl is the smallest cargo I've ever had to transport. Yet by far the most troublesome. Does that seem right to you?"
Simon: "What'd he do?"
Early: "Who?"
Simon: "The midget."
Early: "Arson. Little man loved fire."

River/Serenity: "You're wrong about River.  River's not on the ship.  They didn't want her here, but she couldn't make herself leave.  So she melted... Melted away.  They didn't know she could do that, but she did."
Early: "I'm not sure I take your meaning there."
River/Serenity: "I'm not on the ship.  I'm in the ship." (beat) "I am the ship."
Simon: "River..."
River/Serenity: "River's gone."
Early: "Then who exactly are we talking to?"
River/Serenity: "You're talking to Serenity.  And, Early... Serenity is very unhappy."
%
Early: "I only hurt people because they keep getting in the way of me finding you." (to Simon): "Tell her."
Simon: "What am I?  Your advocate?"
Early: (aiming his gun) "You are now."
Simon: "He's really very... gentle... and fuzzy.  We're becoming fast friends."

Mal: "There's a guy.. he's very blurry.  You gotta be careful." (beat) "Oh... how come there's a guy on board?  How come you're all of a sudden the ship?"

Mal: "That would be why I just asked them."
%
River: "Permission to come aboard?"
Mal: "You know, you ain't quite right."

Simon: "How much did they offer you to sell me and River on Ariel?"
Jayne: (beat) "Das crazy talk."
Simon: "Then let's talk crazy. How much. "
Jayne: (looking beyond Simon. calls out) "Is anybody there?"
(River leans in from the doorway)
Jayne: (Quieter) "Anybody else?"
Simon: "You're in a dangerous line of work, Jayne. Odds are, you'll be under my knife again. Often. So I want you to understand one thing very clearly. No matter what you do, or say, or plot... no matter how you come down on us
I will never ever harm you.  You're on this table you're safe. I'm your medic, and however little we may like or trust each other, we're on the same crew. Got the same troubles, same enemies and more than enough of both. Now we could circle each other and growl, both sleep with one eye open but that thought wearies me. I don't care what you've done. I don't know what you're planning on doing, but I'm trusting you. I think you should do the same, cause I don't see this working any other way."

Jayne: "Here's  a little concept I been workin' on. Why don't we shoot her first?"
Wash: "It is her turn."

Simon: "What will they do?"
Zoe: "If they take the ship, they'll rape us to death, eat our flesh and sew our skins into their clothing and if we're very very lucky, they'll do it in that order."

Mal: "Now, you only gotta scare him."
Jayne: (beat) "Pain is scary."

Niska: "You do not like I kill this man?"

(Mal, fighting with his torturer on the edge of the factory shaft precipice,

aim; however, Zoe grabs his arm.)

He robbed from the rich
 and he gave to the poor.
 Stood up to the man
 and gave him what for.
 Our love for him now
 ain't hard to explain.
 The hero of Canton
 the man they call Jayne. 
 
Our Jayne saw the mudders' backs breakin'. 
 He saw the mudders'lament. 
 And he saw the Magistrate takin' 
 every dollar and leavin' five cents. 
 So he said "You can't do that to my people." 
 He said "You can't crush them under your heel." 
 So Jayne strapped on his hat 
 and in 5 seconds flat 
 stole everythin' Boss Higgins had to steal. 
 
He robbed from the rich 
 and he gave to the poor. 
 Stood up to the man 
 and gave him what for. 
 Our love for him now 
 ain't hard to explain. 
 The hero of Canton 
 the man they call Jayne. 
 
Now here is what separates heroes 
 from common folk like you and I. 
 The man they call Jayne 
 he turned 'round his plane 
 and let that money hit sky. 
 
He dropped it onto our houses 
 he dropped it into our yards. 
 The man they called Jayne 
 he stole away our pain 
 and headed out for the stars! 
 
Here we go! 
 
He robbed from the rich 
 and he gave to the poor. 
 Stood up to the man 
 and gave him what for. 
 Our love for him now 
 ain't hard to explain.

Take my love, take my land
Take me where I cannot stand

You can't take the sky from me
There's no place I can be
Since I found Serenity
But you can't take the sky from me...

Crow: "Keep the money.  Use it to buy a funeral.  It doesn't matter where you go, or how far you fly.  I will hunt you down, and the last thing you see will be my blade."

Zoe: "Jayne slits my throat and takes over." 
Wash: "That's right." 
Zoe: "And we can't stop it."

Jayne: "Anyone remember her coming at me with a butcher knife?"
Wash: "Wacky fun..."
Jayne: "You want to go, little man?"
Wash: "Only if it's someplace with candlelight."
%
Zoe: "I don't think she'd harm anyone."
Jayne: "Butcher knife!"
Zoe: "Anyone we can't spare."
%
Kaylee: "Didn't make much account of myself, I'm afraid."
Mal: "I got no problem with the notion of you not killing no one, Kaylee."
%
Kaylee: "She just did the math."
%
Inara: "This is not a joking matter!  This is about our lives!  And River's."
%
Simon: "She's just a kid.  She just... wants to be a kid."
%
Kaylee: "Don't let the space bugs bite!  (embarassed, to herself) "Space bugs?"
%
Early: "Strains the mind a bit.  You think you're all alone... Maybe I come down the chimney, Kaylee.  Bring presents to all the good girls and boys. 
Maybe not, though.  Maybe I've always been here."
%
Simon: "And which part of your plan dictated the necessity of beating up a shepard?"
Early: "That ain't a shepard."
%
Early: "Is it still her room when it's empty?  Does the room, the thing, have purpose?  Or do we... What's the word?"
Simon: "I really can't help you."
%
Simon: "So you're a bounty hunter."
Early: "That ain't it at all."
Simon: "Then what are you?"
Early: "I'm a bounty hunter."
%
Early: "You ever been shot?"
Simon: "No."
Early: "You out to be shot.  Or stabbed.  Lose a leg.  To be a surgeon, you know.  Know what kind of pain you're dealing with."
%
Simon: "Come on out, River.  The nice man wants to kidnap you."
%
Inara: "This is pointless, you know."
Early: "200,000 seems fairly pointed to me."
%
Early: "Where'd she go?"
Simon: "I can't keep track of her when she's not incorporeally possessing a spaceship.  Don't look at me."
%
Mal: "Am I dreaming?"
River/Serenity: "We all are." (beat) "Don't make faces."
%
Wash: "How about his face?  Is his face wearing armor?"
River/Serenity: "No touching guns!"
%
Early: "I'll be a son of a whore!  You're not in my gorram mind!  You're in my gorram ship!"
%
River/Serenity: "You're not right, Early.  You're not righteous.  You got issues.
Early: "No.  Well, yes.  I could have that."
%
River: "Don't belong.  Dangerous, like you.  Can't be controlled.  Can't be trusted.  Everyone can just go on without me and not have to worry.  People could be what they wanted to be.  Could be with the people they wanted. Live simple.  No secrets..."
Simon: "No..."
River: "I'll be fine.  I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early.  And I'll just fade away."
%
Zoe: "This is really not my area of expertise, doctor.  I tend to be putting these into people more than the other thing."
Wash: "Can I mop your brow?  I am at the ready with the fearsome brow mopper."
Simon: "You got the bullet.  Okay, I'm going to pass out now, but you're doing great."
%
Jayne: "All them years of priest training, taken out by one bounty hunter."
Book: "Don't get me wrong, I gave him a hell of a fight."
Jayne: "Epic, I'm guessing."
Book: "There'll be poems and songs, just you wait."
Jayne: "At least you got some play.  I missed every damn thing."
%
Early (drifting): "Well... here I am..."
%
Wash: "Could you please tell my wife the fun she's missing out on?"
Inara: "Ariel's quite nice place, actually.  There are some lovely museums, not to mention some of the finest restaurants in the quadrant."
Wash: "But not boring like she made it sound."
%
Mal: "You could have got off with Shepard Book at Bathgate Abbey.  You could have been meditating on the wonders of your rock garden by now."
Jayne: "Well, it beats just sitting."
Wash: "It IS just sitting."
%
Simon: "Could you not do that while we're... ever?"
%
Wash: "Two days in a hospital?  Don't you just hate doctors?"
Simon: "Hey!"
Wash: "Present company excluded."
Jayne: "Let's not be excluding people.  It's rude."
%
Jayne: "If I wanted schooling, I'd have gone to school."
%
Simon: "Agent McGinnis, I'm certain you're working under a superior keeping close tabs on this case. I'm certain of that because important people don't do fieldwork. I'm also certain your superior wants me and my sister alive. Now, I'm not going to move from this start until one of two things happens: you answer my very simple question, or you shoot me."
McGinnis: "We're transferring you to a holding center, until you can be retrieved."
Simon: "Retrieved? By who?"
McGinnis: "People who want you alive.  People not me."
%
Jayne: Shee-nio high tech Alliance crap!"
%
Mal: "You called the Feds."
Jayne: "What?  I got pinched!"
Mal: "What is what happens when you call the Feds."
%
Mal: "I hear they used to keelhaul traitors back in the day.  I don't have a keel to haul you on, so..."
%
Jayne: "What are you taking this so personal for? It ain't like I ratted you out to the Feds."
Mal: "But you did. You turn on any of my crew, you turn on me! If that's a concept that you can't seem to wrap your head around, then you got no place here. You did it to me, Jayne, and that's a fact."
%
Jayne: "Tell you what I think -- I figure that fellow we ran into, did everyone on board. Then he decided to take a swim, see how fast his blood boiled out his ears."
Wash: "You're a very "up" person."
%
Book: "Should I remind you of the story of the Good Samaritan?"
Mal: "I'd rather if you didn't."
%
Jayne: "It's impressive what 'nothing' can do to a man. Like that fellow we bumped into. He's likely stuck up under our belly about now. That's what space trash does, you know. Kind of latches onto the first big something stops long enough. Hey, now -- that'd be a bit like you and your sister, wouldn't it?"
%
Mal: "No one's gonna hurt you... any more than we already did."
%
Simon: "Ah, yes.  He's a real beast.  It's a wonder you're still alive."
Jayne: "...Looked bigger when I couldn't see him."
%
Commander: "Looks to me like an illegal salvage operation."
Mal: "It does?  That's discouraging."
%
River: "Let's go again!"
Simon: "Later.  Maybe."
%
Simon: "I swear - when it's appropriate."
Kaylee: "Simon, the whole point of swearing is that it ain't appropriate."
%
Simon: "Son of a bitch!"
%
Book: "You don't fix faith, River.  It fixes you."
%
Wash: "We gotta go to a crappy town where I'm a hero!"
%
Simon: "You know... I've saved lives. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. I reattached a girl's leg - her whole leg. She named her hamster after me. I got a hamster. He drops a box money, he gets a town."
Kaylee: "Hamsters is nice."
Simon: "To Jayne! The box-dropping, man-ape-gone-wrong... thing."
%
River: "They say the snow on the roof was too heavy. The ceiling will cave in, his brains are in terrible danger!"
Book: "River? Please. Why don't you come out?"
River: "No! Can't! Too much hair!"
%
Zoe: "River, honey, he's putting the hair away now."
River: "Doesn't matter.  It'll still be there... waiting."
%
Zoe: "Is that Jayne? Is that really him? Wash, pinch me, I must be dreaming!"
%
Inara: "I.. I know this man. He's... he just has this idiotic sense of nobility, you know?  He can never just let things go. He thinks he's this hard-hearted criminal and he can be unrelenting, but... there's a side to him that's so...."
Fess: "You mean you actually know Jayne?"
Inara: "Jayne? Jayne Cobb?"
%
River: "Just keep walking, preacher-man."
%
Mal: "It's my estimation that... every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sumbitch or another. It ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need."
%
Mal: "Next time you decide to stab me in the back, have the guts to do it to my face."
%
River: "Is it time to go to sleep again?"
Simon: "No, mei mei.  It's time to wake up."
%
Saffron: "I'd be a good wife."
Mal: "Yeah, well, I'd be a terrible husband.  You got five whole days to figure that out."
%
Mal: "Can I come in?"
Inara: "No."
Mal: "See, that's why I usually don't ask."
%
Inara: "Come into my shuttle."
Saffron: "You would lie with me?"
(alarms sound)
Inara: "I guess we've lied enough."
%
Book: "You were victimized, Wash was assaulted, and then Inara found you here."
Inara (groggy): "And then I fell and hit my head.  Like Wash."
%
Mal: "So why the big act?  What was she after?"
Book: "Besides molesting innocent captains?"
Mal: "You want to stow it, preacher?  We're in some peril here."
%
Zoe: "If she can fly this thing, why'd she take the shuttle?"
Wash: "Maybe she likes shuttles.  Some people juggle geese!"
%
Mal: "You got all kinds of learning, and you make me look a fool without even trying, and yet here I am with a gun to your head. That's cause I got people with me, people who trust each other, and do for each other, and ain't always looking for an advantage."
Saffron: "Promise me you're going to kill me soon."
%
Mal: "Try and see past what she is, to what she can be."
Zoe: "What's that, sir?"
Mal: "Freedom, that's what."
Zoe: "I meant, what's that?"
Mal: "Oh. Yeah, just step around that. I think something must have been living in here."
%
Zoe: "Get her running again?"
Mal: "Yeah.
Zoe: "So, not running now?"
Mal: "Not so much."
%
Simon: "How did you know?  River, did you...?"
River: "Day is a vestigal mode of time measurement based on solar cycles. It's not applicable."  (beat)  "I didn't get you anything."
%
Inara: "I love this ship.  I have from the first moment I saw it."
Simon: "I just don't want to die on it."
Inara: "I don't want to die at all."
%
Mal: "Wave your arms around, jump up and down, divert the navsats to the
transmitter, whatever."
Wash: "Divert the navsats to-- Right! Because teenage pranks are fun when you're about to die!"
%
Wash: "Even if some passerby did happen to receive it, all it would do is muck up their navigation."
Mal: "Could be that's true."
Wash: "Damn right it's true! They'd be forced to stop and dig out our signal before they could even go anyplace."
(Mal stares)
Wash: "Well, maybe I should do that, then!"
Mal: "Maybe you should!"
Wash: "Okay!"
Mal: "Good!"
Wash: "Fine!"
%
Jayne: "Jayne'll be worth something if you run into trouble, but don't trust him, and don't let him take over. You're paid up through the end of the month, this is still your ship."
Inara: "Mal..."
Jayne: "As far as your security deposit goes, that I might have to owe you. "
%
Mal: "If it's Alliance trouble you got, you might want to consider another ship. Some onboard here fought for the Independents."
Inara: "The Alliance has no quarrel with me. I supported Unification."
Mal: Did ya?  Well, I don't suppose you're the only whore that did."
Inara: "Oh, one further addendum -- that's the last time you get to call me "whore"."
Mal: "Absolutely. Never again."
%
Inara: "Mal, you don't have to die alone."
Mal: "Everybody dies alone."
%
Captain: "Catalyzer's a nothing part, captain."
Mal: "It's nothing until you don't got one. Then it appears to be everything."
%
Mal: "Let's say you did kill us - or didn't.  There could be torture, whatever.  Anyhow..."
%
Captain: "You would have done the same."
Mal: "You can already see I haven't.  Now get the hell off my ship."
%
River:: "We got outflanked by an Independent squad, and we're never gonna make it back to our platoon. We need to resort to cannibalism."
Simon: "That was fast. Don't we have rations or anything?"
River: "They got lost. We're going to have to eat the men."
%
Mr. Tam: "I will not have it in my house. But since your mother's already ordered one, I guess I might as well give up the fantasy that this is my house."
%
Mal: "You know, they walk just as easy if you lead them."
Jayne: "I like smackin' them."
%
Mal: "When a man engages in clandestine dealings, he has this preference for things going smoothly. She makes things not be smooth."
Simon: "Right. I'm very sorry she tipped off anyone about your cunningly concealed herd of cows."
%
Grange: "We can go to 25."
Mal: "Well... we'll be taking a loss. But you seem like clean and virtuous boys. Done."
%
Simon: "Some of these words -- they're misspelled. She started correcting my spelling when she was three."
%
Doralee: "Place like this might be good for your sister. Quiet, safe, place where folks take care of each other."
Simon: "Yes, seems like a lovely little community of kidnappers."
%
River: "I took you away from there."
Simon: "No."
River: "I know I did. You don't think I do, but... I get confused. I remember everything. I remember too much and.... Some of it's made up and... some of it can't be quantified and there's secrets..."
Simon: "It's okay."
River: "But I understand. You gave up everything to find me, and you found me broken. It's hard for you. You gave up everything you had."
Simon: "Mei mei, everything I have is right here."
%
Simon: "These are better than the Camberson's berries."
River: "They are. Except they're poison."
%
Simon: "It's been a big day, with the abduction and all."
%
Simon: "I'm sorry, Dad. You know I would never have tried to save River's life if I'd known there was a dinner party at risk."
%
Mr. Tam: "Are you trying to destroy this family?"
Simon: "I didn't realize it would be so easy."
%
Mal: "So Shepard says to a Companion, "Well, a good goat will do that." "
%
Inara: "I like watching the game. As with other situations, the key seems to be giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back."
Mal: "'Course, they won't discover it 'til they order the next round of drinks."
Thug: "Way."
Mal: "Good drinker, that one."
%
Zoe: "I thought you'd get land-crazy, that long in port."
Wash: "Probably, but I've been sane a while now and change is good."
%
Mal: "Seems to me the last time there was a chance for a little palaver, we were all manner of unwelcome."
Jayne: "This ain't bad."
Badger: "There's a trick to it: wood alcohol."
Mal: "Now we're favored guests, treated to the finest in beverages that make you blind."
%
Bitca: "It's not as good as last year."
Kaylee: "Oh, really? What'd they have last year?"
Bitca: "Standards."
%
Gentleman: "Why, Banning Miller! What a vision you are in your fine dress. It must have taken a dozen slaves a dozen days to get you into that gown. Of course, your daddy tells me it takes the space of a schoolboy's wink to get you out of it."
%
Inara: "I see Kaylee's here."
Mal: "Cried Cinderella tears. You should have seen her when I told her she could have that layer cake she's wearing."
Inara: "I think she looks adorable."
Mal: "Yeah, but I never said it."
%
Kaylee: Up until the punching, it was a real nice party.
%
Inara: "Atherton's a heavy sleeper the night before a big day. You know, he's got the killing in the morning, then a haircut later."
Mal: "Such a comfort, having friends visit at a time like this."
%
Mal: "I never back down from a fight!"
Inara: "Yes, you do. You do all the time."
%
Inara: "He's an expert swordsman, Mal -- you had trouble with the pillar. How will your death help my honor?"
%
Jayne: "What we need's a diversion. I say Zoe gets naked."
Wash: "Nope."
Jayne: "I could get naked."
Wash and Simon, in unison: "No!"
%
Badger: "Why ain't she talking? She's got a secret."
River: "Sure, I got a secret. More'n one. Don't seem likely I'd tell them to you now, do it? Anyone off Dyton Colony knows better than to talk to strangers. You're talkin' loud enough for the both of us, though, ain't you? I've known a dozen like you. Skipped off home early. Run graft jobs 'ere and there. Spent some time in the lockdown, but less than you claim. Now you're what? Petty thief with illusions of standing. Sad little king of a sad little hill."
Badger: "...Nice to see someone from the old homestead."
River: "Not really."  (to Simon)  "Call me if anyone interesting shows up."
%
Jayne: "That there? Exactly the kind of diversion we could have used."
%
Inara: "You have a strange sense of nobility. You'll lay a man out for implying I'm a whore, but you keep calling me one to my face."
%
Inara: "You are always breaking the rules, no matter what society you're in! You don't get along with ordinary criminals either, which is why you are constantly getting in trouble!"
Mal: "And you think following rules will buy you a nice life, even if the rules make you a slave."
%
Atherton: "You set this up, whore! After I bought and paid for you. I should have uglied you up so no one else would want you."
Mal: "See how I'm not punching him? I think I've grown."
%
Atherton: "Well, get ready to starve! I'll see to it you never work again."
Inara: "Actually, that's not how it works. You see, you've earned yourself a black mark in the client registry. No Companion is going to contact with you ever again."
Harrow: "You'll have to rely on your winning personality to get women. God help you."
%
Jayne: "We was just about to spring into action. Very complicated search-and-rescue operation."
Wash: "I was going to watch. It was very exciting."
%
Inara: "I am grateful, you know. For the ill-conceived and high-handed attempt to defend my honor although I didn't want you to."
%
(Mal makes a move in Chinese Checkers)
Zoe: "That's a bold move."
Mal: "I live on the edge."
(Zoe makes a devastating move)
Jayne (to Mal): "Nice work, dumbass."
Mal: "I've given some thought to moving off the edge. Not an ideal location. Maybe a place in the middle...."
%
Drunk: "I'm thinking you're one of them Independents."
Mal: "And I'm thinking you weren't overburdened with schooling. So why don't we both ignore each other until we go away."
%
Jayne: "Hey, I didn't fight in no war. Best of luck, though."
%
Wash: "Every man there go back inside, or we will blow a new crater in this little moon."
%
Jayne: "Damn yokels can't even tell a transport freighter ain't got no guns on it."
%
Kaylee: "So, what happpened? Was there a terrible brawl?"
Zoe: "Oddly enough, there was."
Wash: "Are you getting my wife into trouble?"
Mal: "What? I didn't start it! I just wanted a quiet drink."
Zoe: "Funny, sir, how you always seem to find yourself in an Alliance-friendly bar come U-Day, looking for a quiet drink."
Mal: "See, this is another sign of your tragic space dementia, all paranoid and crotchety. It breaks the heart."
%
River: "Mal. Bad. In the Latin."
%
Inara: "You have such lovely hair. I'm sure the doctor would agree."
Kaylee: "Who, Simon? No, he's too... I'm just... Do you think it would look better up?"
Inara: "We could experiment. We might even get wild later and wash your face."
%
Inara: "There's an energy about a person that's difficult to hide. You try to feel that..."
Mal: "And then you try to feel the energy around their credit account. It has a sort of aura..."
%
Mal: "You're servicing crew now?"
Inara: "In your lonely and pathetic dreams."
%
Inara: "You could always pray they make it back safely."
Book: "I don't think the captain would much like me praying for him."
Inara: "So don't tell him. I never do."
%
Zoe: "Sir, I think you have a problem with your brain being missing."
%
River: "They won't stop. They'll never stop. They'll just keep coming until they get back what you took. Two by two, hands of blue. Two by two, hands of blue..."
%
Inara: "Zoe. What would your husband say if he knew you were here?"
Zoe: "I... I was weak."
%
Sherrif: "His story had kind of an odor to it."
Inara: "Yes. It's not the only thing about him that does."
%
Sherrif: "You were truthful back in town -- these are tough times. A man can get a job, he might not look too close at what that job is. But a man learns all the details of a situation like ours.... well, then he has a choice. "
Mal: "I don't believe he does."
%
Book: "He said, 'Live with a man forty years, share his house, his meals, speak on every subject... then tie him up and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.' "
Simon: "What if you don't live near a volcano?"
Book: "I expect he was being poetical."
Simon: "Sadistic crap legitimized by florid prose. Tell me you're not a fan."
Book: "I'm just wondering if they were. The people who did this to your sister."
%
Book: "A government is a body of people -- usually notably ungoverned."
Simon: "Now you're quoting the captain."
%
Mal: "Don't worry, I'm not gonna start any sword fights -- I'm over that phase."
%
Mal: "One of you is going to fall and kill yourself, and I'm not cleaning it up!"
%
Wash: "It's Jayne being so generous with his cut that confuses and frightens me."
Zoe: "It does kind of freeze the blood."
%
Zoe: "We mentioned that we were out of rations, and ten minutes later, a bunch of appples rained into the trench."
Wash: "And they grew into a big tree, and they all climbed up the tree into a magical land with unicorns and a harp."
%
Wash: "I love that you two are old Army buddies, you have wacky stories with rib cages in them, but could you have an opinion of your own, please?"
Zoe: "You're losing the high ground here, sweetcakes."
%
Wash: "I am a large, semi-muscular man. I can take it. Don't hide behind Mal because you know he'll shoot it down!"
Zoe: "Right. Becaue what this marriage needs is one more shouting match.
Wash: No, what this marriage needs is one less husband. Right now it's kind of crowded."
%
River: "Going back. Like apple bits, coming back up."
Simon: "But you felt okay this morning?"
River: "Played with Kaylee. The sun came out and I walked on my feet and heard with my ears. I hate the bits.. the bits that stay down and I work, I function like I'm a girl. I hate it because I know it'll go away. The sun grows dark and chaos has come again. Bits. Fluids.... What am I?"
Simon: "You are my beautiful sister."
River: "I threw up on your bed."
Simon: "Yup. Definitely my sister."
%
Book: "This is precision work; sharpshooters. From the look of these wounds, I'd say a 54-R sniper rifle. Laser sights."
Jayne: "Do a lot of shooting at the abbey there, Shepard?"
Book: "Rabbits."
%
Niska: "Ah... now you have to..."
Zoe: "Him. I'm sorry, you were going to tell me to choose. Do you want to finish?"
%
Zoe: "We're getting him back!"
Jayne: "What are we going to do, clone him?"
%
Niska: "This is not a time for extraordinary men. Business is not war, heroics are unseemly. They complicate."
%
Wash: "Grenades?"
Zoe: "Oh, yes. Thank you, dear."
%
Zoe: "We're going to get the captain."
Kaylee: "Oh, good.... Can they do that?"
Jayne: "No."
%
Zoe: "It's like throwing a dart, Jayne, and hitting a bullseye 6,000 miles away. That's my man."
%
Zoe: "Okay, people -- if it moves, shoot it."
Kaylee: "Unless it's the captain!"
Zoe: "Unless it's the captain."
%
Mal: "Listen, if you got guests, I can come back later."
%
Inara: "I just wish you'd killed that old bastard."
Mal: "I got regrets on that score my own self."
%
Simon: "I never shot anyone before."
Book: "I was there, son. I'm fair sure you haven't shot anyone yet."
%
Mal: "Had a good day."
Simon: "You had the alliance on you, criminals and savages, half the people on this ship have been shot or wounded, including yourself, and you're harboring known fugitives."
Mal: "We're still flyin'."
Simon: "That's not much."
Mal: "It's enough."

Mal: "Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc."

Simon: "I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider."

Mal: "We mean to be theiving here, but what we are after is not yours.  So let's have no undue fuss."
%
Mal: "Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all."
%
Jayne: "Mal!  MAL!"
Mal: "Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name."
%
Mal (being pursued closely by Reavers): "Faster.  Faster.  Faster would be better!!!"
%
Jayne (being attacked by reavers, after being made to leave his weapons behind): "Boy, sure would be nice to have some GRENADES, don'tcha think?"
%
Jayne: "I won't get et!  You shoot me if they take me!"
(Mal aims toward Jayne in an attempt to free him)
Jayne: "Well don't shoot me FIRST!"
%
River: "Put a bullet to me.  Bullet in the brainpan, squish."
%
River: "It isn't mine.  The memory.  I didn't bring it and I shouldn't have to carry it, it isn't mine."
%
River: "He didn't lie down.  They never lie down."
%
Kaylee (to Simon): "Are you okay?"
Mal: "Is HE okay?"
Simon (rushing to River, who is seemingly unfazed): River?
River: "I swallowed a bug."
%
Jayne: "I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's going to start a fair fight... or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman.. or I'm gettin' paid. Mostly if i'm gettin' paid."
%
Kaylee (to Simon, as he leaves): "Don't ride in antyhing with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky!"
%
Zoe: "In the time of war, we woulda never left a man stranded."
Mal: "Maybe that's why we lost."
%
Zoe: "You know what the definition of a hero is?  It's someone who gets other people killed.  You can look it up later."
%
Mal: "Mingo.  Fanty."
Mingo (pointing to Fanty): "He's Mingo."
Mal: "He's Fanty.  You're Mingo."
Mingo: "Ghahh!  How is it you always know?"
Mal: "Fanty's prettier."
%
Kaylee: "Goin' on a year now I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries."
Mal: "Oh God!  I can't know that!"
Jayne: "I could stand to hear a little more..."
%
Fanty: "You know that girl?"
Mal: "I really don't..."
%
Wash: "Can we start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl?  'Cause I don't think that's ever getting old."
%
Jayne (interrupting the "safe words" that make River fall asleep): "Well don't say it!!!"
Wash: "It only works on her, Jayne."
Jayne: "Oh.  Well, now I know that."
%
Jayne: "Didn't we have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?"
Kaylee: "We couldn't leave them now...!"
Jayne: "No, now that she's a... killer woman, we oughta be bringing her tea and dumplings."
%
Mr. Universe: "You guys always bring me the very best violence."
%
Simon: "Am I talking to Miranda now?"  (River makes a face)  "No.  Right."
%
Book: "You got a plan?"
Mal: "Hiding ain't a plan?"
%
Book: "When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?"
%
Mal: "Kaylee's been missing you something fierce."
%
Zoe: "So.. Trap?"
Mal: "Trap."
Zoe: "We goin' in?"
Mal: "Ain't nothin' but a few hours out."
Wash: "But, remember the part where it's a trap?"
%
Kaylee: "How can you be sure Inara just don't wanna see you?  Sometimes people have feelings - I'm referring here to people..."
Mal: "Y'all were watching, I take it?"
(guilty glances)
Mal: "Did you see us fight?"
Kaylee: "No."
Mal: "Trap."
%
Mal: "Zoe, ship is yours.  ...you don't hear from me within the hour, you take this ship and you come and rescue me!"
Zoe: "What?  And risk my ship?"
%
Mal: "Dear Buddha: please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and..."
%
Inara: "Mal, what are you doing here?"
Mal: "You invited me."
Inara: "Yes, but I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come!"
Mal: "Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?"
%
Operative: "It's worse than you know."
Mal: "It usually is."
%
Mal: "If the alliance wanted to show me reason, they shouldn't have sent an assassin."
%
Operative: "I want to resolve this like civilized men.  I'm not threatening you.  I'm unarmed."
Mal: "Good." (draws and fires; operative falls to the ground, but comes back up fighting)
Operative: "I am of course wearing full body armor.  I am not a moron."
%
Operative (to Mal): "You can not make me angry."
Inara: "Please - spend an hour with him!"
%
Operative (to ensign): "Define 'disappeared'."
%
Operative: "I'm impressed that you would come for her yourself.  And that you would make it this far in that outfit."
%
Operative: "Nothing here is what it seems.  He's not the plucky hero.  The Alliance isn't some evil empire.  This isn't the grand arena."
Inara: "And that's not incense." (explosion ensues)
%
Operative: "Have you found the nav sat?"
Officer: "Sir?  We found seven."
%
Zoe: "Do you really think any of us are gonna get through this?"
Jayne: "... I might..."
%
Book: "It's not your way."
Mal: "I have a way?  Is that better than a plan?"
%
Operative: "I'm a monster.  What I do is evil, I've no illusions about that.  But it must be done."
%
Book: "They'll come at you sideways.  It's how they think: sideways.  Sidle up and smile, hit you where you're weak."
%
Jayne: "No offense, Doc, I think it's noble as a grape the way you look after River, but she ain't my sister..."
%
Mal: "You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place.  So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.  Maybe all.  'Cause as sure as I know anything, I know this: they will try again.  ...they'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better.  And I do not hold to that.  So no more running.  I aim to misbehave."
%
Operative: "That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.  She's an albatross, Captain."
Mal: "Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck... till some idiot killed it." (to Inara) "Yes, I've read a poem.  Try not to faint."
%
Mal: "Are you anything but a weapon?  I've staked my crew's life on the theory that you're a person, actual and whole, and if I'm wrong, you'd better shoot me now..."
(River cocks gun)
Mal: "... or, we could talk more."
%
River: "I had to show them.  I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep."
Simon: "You could have asked."
%
Mal: "Do you want to run this ship?"
Jayne: "Yes."
Mal: (beat) "Well... you can't!"
%
Inara: "I just want to know who I'm dealing with.  I've seen too many versions of you to be sure."
Mal: "I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new."
%
Mal: ".... I wish like hell you was elsewhere."
Inara: "I was."
%
Wash: "Can I suggest something that doesn't involve violence, or is this the wrong crowd for that?"
%
Simon: "We'll get off.  River and I will get off and..."
Zoe: "Nobody's saying that."
Wash: "Nobody besides Jayne is saying that."
%
Mal (to a badly injured Book): "Shepherd... don't move."
Book: "Won't go far."
%
Book: "I shot him down... I killed the ship... that killed us.  Not very Christian of me."
Mal: "You did what's right."
Book: "...coming from you, that means... almost nothing."
%
Mal: "Shouldn't have been you - they shoulda hit us."
Book: "That crossed my mind..."
%
River: "Runtse duh shang-dee, ching daiwuhtzo [Merciful God, please take me away].  Make them stop, they're everywhere, every city every house every room, they're all inside me.  I can hear them all and they're saying nothing! GET UP!  PLEASE GET THEM UP!  Wuoshang mayer, maysheen, byen shr-too [I will close my ears and my heart and I will be a stone], please God, make me a stone!"
Jayne: "She is starting to damage my calm."
%
Mal (after Simon punches him): "Tzao ss-ma?  Nee-yow wuh-kai chang?" [You wanna bullet?  You wanna bullet right in the throat?]
%
(in response to Mal's plan to Reaverize Serenity)
Inara: "Runtse de fwotzoo, ching baoyo wuomun..." [Oh merciful buddha protect us...]
Wash: "Juhguh jee hua jun kuhpah!" [This plain is horrific]
%
Mal: "It's of interest to me how much you know about that world."
Book: "I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal."
Mal: "Have to tell me about that sometime."
Book: "No, I don't."
%
Mal: "And we're gonna need paint.  We're going to need red paint."
%
Zoe: "Sir.  Do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination so we can make a suicidal attempt at passing through Reaver space?"
Mal: "I mean to live.  I mean for us to live.  The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow."
%
Zoe: "How much ammo is left?"
Jayne: "Three mags and my swinging cod!"
%
Simon: "River - I'm sorry..."
River: "No.  No."
Simon: "I hate to... leave..."
River: "You won't.  You take care of me.  You've always taken care of me." 
(pause)  "My turn."
%
Zoe: "The Alliance knows about Mr. Universe.  They're gonna see this coming."
Mal: "No.  They're not going to see this coming."
%
Operative: "Target the reavers.  Target the reavers!  Target everything!  Somebody, fire!!!"
%
Simon: "My one true regret in all this is never being with you."
Kaylee: "With me?  You mean to say, as... sex?"
Simon: "... I mean to say."
Kaylee (cocking gun): "Hell with this!  I'm gonna live!"
%
Operative: "It's finished.  We're finished."
%
Mr. Universe: "They can't stop the signal, Mal.  They can never stop the signal."
%
Mr. Universe/lovebot: "Mal?  Guy killed me, Mal.  He killed me with a sword. How weird is that?"
%
Mal (looking at the transmitter past a fall to certain doom): "'Hard to get to'?!  That's a fact!"
%
Operative: "Are you willing to die for that belief?"
Mal: (beat) "Yes."  (He and the Operative draw on each other.  Mal fires first, disarming the Operative.)  " 'Course, that ain't exactly plan A."
%
Mal: "That's what you want, isn't it?"
Inara: "I don't know."
Mal: "Good answer."
%
Operative: "Do you know what your sin is?
Mal: "Aw hell, I'm a big fan of all seven... but right now, I'm gonna have to go with wrath."
%
Wash: "I am a leaf on the wind.  Watch how I soar."
%
Mal: "I ain't gonna kill you.  Hell, I'm gonna grant your greatest wish.  I'm gonna show you a world without sin."
%
Mal: "Ok, clearly some aptitude for this, but it ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross. You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say. "
River: "I do. But I like to hear you say it."
Mal: "Love. You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat into the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens. Makes her a home."
River: "Storm's getting worse."
Mal: "We'll pass through it soon enough."
%
Operative: "When your quarry goes to ground, leave no ground to go to."
%
Mal: "Half of writing history is hiding the truth."
%
Zoe: "She's tore up plenty.  But she'll fly true."
%
Jayne: "Go hwong-tong [Enough of this nonsense].  No trouble now, little crazy person...  we're going for a nice shuttle ride..."
%
Mal: "Keep on talking... You're not getting a location trace off this wave..."
%
River: "I can't shut them up, they're all made up of rage..."
%
Mal: "Zoe?  Are you here?"
Zoe: "Do the job, sir."
Mal.  You hold.  Hold till I'm back."
%
Operative: "You should know there's no shame in this.  You've done remarkable things.  But you're fighting a war you've already lost."
Mal: "Yeah, I'm known for that."
%
Mal: "I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job."
Jayne: "Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar."
%
Mal: "Just get us on the ground!"
Wash: "That part'll happen, pretty definitely."
%
Fanty: "You're unpredictable, Mal... you run when you oughtta fight, fight when you oughtta deal.  Makes a business person twitchy..."
%
River: "Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it... I don't know what I'm saying, I never know what I'm saying..."
%
Operative: "We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo.  I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes."
Mal: "You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord."
(tosses a gadget to the Operative)
Operative: "... pulse beacon..."
%
Mal: "Piece of shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour.  Had it moved."
%
River: "Miranda."
%
Mal: "What was that?"
%
Mal: "I, uh, better go see how the inevitable mutiny is coming along..."
%
Teacher: "...so why would [the independents] fight so hard against us?"
River: "We meddle."
Teacher: "River?"
River: "People don't like to be meddled with.  We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run don't walk we're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.  We're meddlesome."
Teacher: "River, we're not telling people what to think.  We're just trying to show them how."
%
Dr. Mathias: "All our subjects are conditioned for combat, but River... she's a creature of extraordinary grace."
Simon: "Yes.  She always did love to dance."
%
Operative: "We're making a better world.  All of them, better worlds."
%
Zoe: "Nobody flies like my mister."
%
Simon: "I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks."
Kaylee: "I know the cap'n'll look out for her.  They'll be back before you can spit." (beat)  "Not that you spit."
%
Jayne: "How come they ain't blowin' us out of the air?"
Mal: "They wanna run us down.  The up close kill."
River: "They want us alive when they eat us."
